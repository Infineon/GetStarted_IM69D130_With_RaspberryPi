# Example in Python to access IM69D130 using PyAudio Library

Steps-
1- Follow the document named "Raspberry Pi with MEMS Microphone" to interface Infineon MEMS Microphone with Raspberry pi.

2- Run the example file from the terminal.

Result- #Sound will be recorded for 10 seconds and will be saved as in .wav format file.
	#As enabling the access in Python by using PyAudio multiple other function of the library can be used to work on the data generated by IM69D130.
